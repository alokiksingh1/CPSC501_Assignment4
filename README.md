# CPSC501_Assignment4

This assignment is revolved around developing audio by time convolving two .wav audio fils to generate a new audio file, improving the time of convolution eventually by using Fast Fourier Theorem for Time Domain Convolution

One good example is after convoluting Flute.wav and Taj.wav file to produce this sound :

[FluteFFTTaj.wav.zip](https://github.com/alokiksingh1/CPSC501_Assignment4/files/15327632/FluteFFTTaj.wav.zip)



It does have a bit of static in between but I will definitely fix it if time persists in future. 
This assignment is a great example of putting in work to figure out functioning of FFT algorithm and how quickly the algorithm helps perform the same task that takes 2 minutes to convolve the audio using standard basic techniques.
